                    <p class="text " style="padding:20px;">
                        Terrace greenhouses can provide a great opportunity for people to grow their own fresh
                        produce and plants, but they can also come with some challenges. Here are some
                        problem statements that people might face in terrace greenhouses
                   
                    <ul style="padding:20px;" >
                        <!--<li class="text">-->
                        1) Temperature control: Terrace greenhouses can get very hot during the day and very
                        cold at night, especially if they don't have proper insulation or ventilation. This can be
                        challenging for plants that require a specific temperature range to thrive.
                        <!--</li>-->
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        2)  Watering and irrigation: Proper watering and irrigation can be a challenge in terrace
                        greenhouses, especially if they don't have a water source nearby or if the terrace has
                        limited drainage. Overwatering or underwatering can be detrimental to plants, so it's
                        important to find the right balance.

                        <br />
                        <br />

                        3) Limited space: Terrace greenhouses are often smaller than traditional greenhouses,
                        which can make it challenging to grow a large variety of plants or to accommodate
                        larger plants. It's important to plan carefully and choose plants that are well-suited for
                        the available space.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        4) Structural integrity: Terrace greenhouses need to be sturdy enough to withstand wind,
                        rain, and other weather conditions. It's important to ensure that the greenhouse is built
                        to withstand the specific environmental conditions in the area and that it is regularly
                        inspected for any signs of wear or damage.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        5) Limited sunlight: Depending on the location and orientation of the terrace, it may
                        receive limited sunlight, which can be a challenge for plants that require a lot of light to
                        grow. It's important to choose plants that are well-suited for the available light conditions and
                        to consider adding artificial lighting if necessary.

                    <p class="text " style="padding:20px;">
                        An AIOT-based greenhouse monitoring system is a system that combines
                        Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to monitor
                        and control various parameters in a greenhouse environment.
                        The system typically consists of a network of sensors and devices that collect
                        data on various parameters such as temperature, humidity, light, soil moisture,
                        and plant growth. These sensors transmit data to a central hub or server, where
                        the data is processed and analyzed using AI algorithms. Based on the analysis, the system can automatically control the environmental
                        conditions in the greenhouse by adjusting parameters such as temperature,
                        humidity, and light to create optimal conditions for plant growth. This can include
                        controlling heating and cooling systems, turning on or off lights, and adjusting the
                        amount of water provided to the plants.
                        The system can also provide alerts to the user if any parameters fall outside of
                        their predetermined ranges. For example, if the temperature in the greenhouse
                        becomes too high, the system can send an alert to the user's phone or email,
                        allowing them to take appropriate act. Overall, an AIOT-based greenhouse monitoring system can help growers
                        optimize their crop yields, reduce energy usage, and minimize the need for
                        manual intervention

                        This automated greenhouse can offer a more efficient, productive, and profitable
                        way of growing crops.<br />
                        ● Consistent quality: With precise control over growing conditions, crops can be
                        grown to consistent standards, resulting in higher quality produce.<br />
                        ● Reduced labour costs: Automation can reduce the need for manual labour, which
                        can save on labour costs and improve efficiency.<br />
                        ● Efficient use of resources: By using technology to optimise growing conditions,an
                        automated greenhouse can use resources more efficiently, reducing waste and
                        saving money.<br />
                        ● Better pest and disease management: Automation can help to detect and control
                        pests and diseases more effectively, reducing the risk of crop loss.
